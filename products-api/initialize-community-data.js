    question: 'How do I overcome the feeling of being stuck in my career progression?',
    answer: "This is a common feeling when you've mastered your current role but aren't seeing clear paths forward. First, identify whether you're seeking vertical advancement (promotion) or horizontal growth (new skills).\n\nFor vertical growth, have you clearly communicated your ambitions to decision-makers? Many professionals assume their work \"speaks for itself\" when in reality, intentional career conversations are necessary.\n\nFor horizontal growth, consider cross-functional projects that let you develop adjacent skills while demonstrating value. This creates new pathways that might not be visible from your current vantage point.",
    reflection: "When I felt plateaued at my previous company, I created a \"skunkworks\" project addressing a gap our clients were experiencing. This eventually became a new service offering and created a fresh growth path.",

    question: "I feel like I'm at the ceiling of my current role, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for management. What are my options?",
    answer: "This crossroads is actually an opportunity to design your ideal next chapter. The traditional individual contributor ‚Üí manager path isn't the only route to growth.\n\nConsider the expert path (deepening your technical or domain expertise to become a thought leader), the mentor path (coaching others while staying in your role), or the innovator path (solving new business problems using your specialized knowledge).\n\nMany organizations now recognize these alternative advancement tracks, but you may need to advocate for creating such a position if it doesn't exist yet.",

    question: "How can I deal with stress and prevent burnout when working on tight deadlines?",
    answer: "Burnout occurs when we experience prolonged periods of stress without recovery. The key is to integrate small recovery periods throughout your workflow.\n\nStart by using time-blocking techniques like Pomodoro (25 minutes focused work, 5 minutes rest) to create mental breaks. During high-intensity project phases, protect your physiological baseline: prioritize sleep quality, maintain physical movement, and stabilize blood sugar with regular, nutritious meals.\n\nMost importantly, communicate boundaries early. Frame them as methods to maintain your peak performance rather than limitations.",
