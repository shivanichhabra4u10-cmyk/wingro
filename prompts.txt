I need to design a backend for my application, which includes APIs for all pages. Based on the functionality and data requirements of the pages in my workspace, identify the APIs I need to create. For each API, provide the following details:

Endpoint URL.
HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Expected request payload (if applicable).
Expected response structure.
Any authentication or authorization requirements.
Ensure the APIs cover the following pages and their features:

Home: Display dynamic content and call-to-action sections.
WhoWeServe: Provide data for different user categories and solutions.
Marketplace: Manage architects, client profiles, and booking flows.
Products: Handle product listing, creation, updates, and deletion.
CareerAssessment: Save user responses and fetch assessment results.
Knowledge: Provide articles, categories, and resources.
Contact: Submit contact form data and manage inquiries.
JoinAsArchitect: Handle architect applications and manage profiles.
Follow RESTful principles and ensure scalability, security, and maintainability in the API design."

This prompt will help me generate a comprehensive backend API design tailored to your application's needs. Let me know if you want me to proceed with this!
