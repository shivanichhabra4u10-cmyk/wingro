# Products API 404 Error Fix Guide

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing 404 (Not Found) errors when attempting to create products through the admin interface. Specifically:

1. POST requests to `/api/v1/products` and `/v1/products` were failing with 404 errors
2. The admin interface was unable to create new products

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we found that:

1. The client's admin API service (`adminApi.ts`) was using these base URL paths:
   - Primary attempt: `/api/v1/products`
   - Fallback attempt: `/v1/products`

2. However, the server only had routes registered for:
   - `/api/products`
   - `/products`

3. This mismatch in API route patterns resulted in 404 errors when the client tried to create products.

## Solution

We created an enhanced version of the products API that supports all common API path patterns:

1. Added support for the following route patterns:
   - `/api/products` (original)
   - `/products` (original)
   - `/api/v1/products` (new)
   - `/v1/products` (new)

2. Created a script (`fix-products-v1-routes.js`) that implements all routes
3. Created a PowerShell script (`fix-products-v1-routes.ps1`) to run the server and test all endpoints

## Implementation Details

The fix involved:

1. Creating `fix-products-v1-routes.js` which:
   - Maintains all functionality from the original API
   - Adds route handlers for the v1 patterns
   - Logs detailed information about requests
   - Handles graceful shutdown

2. Creating `fix-products-v1-routes.ps1` which:
   - Stops any existing Node.js processes
   - Installs required dependencies
   - Starts the enhanced API server
   - Tests all API endpoints to verify they're working

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Testing the health endpoint to confirm the server is running
2. Testing GET requests to all API path patterns
3. Testing POST requests to the previously failing endpoint
4. Verifying 201 status codes for successful product creation

## Usage Instructions

To deploy this fix:

1. Run `.\fix-products-v1-routes.ps1` to start the enhanced API server
2. The server will start on port 3001
3. All product API requests should now work through any of the supported path patterns

This fix allows the admin interface to create products without modifying the client code.

## Long Term Recommendations

1. Standardize on a single API route pattern across the entire application
2. Update the client code to use the standardized routes
3. Document API conventions for future development
