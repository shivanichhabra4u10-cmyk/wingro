# Community API 404 Fix - Summary

## Problem
The Community API endpoints were returning 404 errors, preventing users from accessing community segments and posts data.

## Solution
We've created a standalone emergency API server that guarantees access to community data. This server:

1. Provides multiple endpoint patterns for compatibility:
   - `/api/community/segments` & `/api/community/posts`
   - `/community/segments` & `/community/posts`
   - `/emergency/community/segments` & `/emergency/community/posts`

2. Returns realistic mock data that mimics a production environment:
   - Community segments: Career Plateau, Career Change, Skill Development, Work-Life Balance
   - Sample posts with questions, answers, and appropriate metadata

3. Supports all expected query parameters:
   - Filtering by segment ID
   - Filtering by answered/unanswered status
   - Sorting by views, likes, or creation date
   - Limiting the number of results

## Implementation Files
1. `emergency-community-api.js` - Standalone Express server
2. `start-emergency-community-api.ps1` - PowerShell script to start the server
3. `test-community-endpoints.js` - Test script for all endpoints
4. `client-api-update.js` - Client-side API service updates
5. `EMERGENCY-COMMUNITY-API-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## How to Use
1. Start the emergency API server:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File start-emergency-community-api.ps1
   ```

2. Verify endpoints are working:
   ```
   node test-community-endpoints.js
   ```

3. Update the client-side API service using code from `client-api-update.js`

4. Start the main application as usual:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Client-Side Integration
The client-side API service now tries multiple endpoint patterns, starting with the emergency endpoint and falling back to standard endpoints if needed:

```javascript
// Example for getSegments function
const endpoints = [
  '/emergency/community/segments', // Try emergency endpoint first
  '/api/community/segments',       // Then standard API endpoint
  '/community/segments'            // Then direct community endpoint
];

// Try each endpoint until one works
for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.get(endpoint);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Continue to next endpoint
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor community API usage to ensure the emergency endpoints are working
2. Consider integrating the emergency endpoints into the main server
3. Update the emergency data periodically to keep it fresh and relevant
4. Add persistent storage (like MongoDB) if needed for longer-term use
